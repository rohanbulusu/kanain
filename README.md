# Kanain
### _All of mathematics, all at once._
The goal of _Kanain_ is to provide a complete description of all of mathematics, using category theory as a base representation. Point-set topology, differential geometry, algebra, and even topos theory will all at some point be integrated into its structure. 

At the heart of _Kanain_ is a powerful symbolic algebra engine, performing operations at lightning speed with unparalleled efficiency. Coupled with novel, cutting-edge data structure organization, it is innovations like this which allow _Kanain_ to do what no other software has ever done before: provide a complete computer-scientific description of mathematics.

While it is by no means complete, this project is in active development, and the _Kanain_ team looks forward to providing clients all of mathematics, all at once.
